These are a set of tools for handling experimental data of circular dichrosis.
At this stage it only handle one type of file (.gen files from a particular Circular Dichrosis Machine)


Case Scenario:
first import the .gen files 
utils/import.cdtool.sh <Input Gen File> <Output xml file>
example:
cd utils
import.cdtool.sh gen/a2500.gen  xmls/a2500.gen.xml

then you can generate graph images using 'gunplot' (And if you don't have it you should)
cd Scripts
GenerateImageGraph.py  -i <XML FILE>  -o  <Graph Image PNG>
this will generate an image file and display it (using 'display').

then if you have xmlto installed, you can use the xslt transform to display file as html
xmlto -x <XSLT Transform> -o <Output HTML file> html <XML FILE>
Example:
xmlto -x xmls/report2.xsl  html ../../xmls/a2500.gen.xml  -o out.html--skip-validation

If you don't have xmlto (and for some reason you don't want it).
I recall writing a java xslt transformer, but i'm not sure.. you'll have to find it (and maybe fix it too).

At this stage it does other things, partially... it has some validation tests, but for now you'll just have to look at the code and or write your own...
it should be fairly easy to adapt the stylesheets to output html+javascript with json and flot charts.
